This is a complete rewrite of `j-i-l/pyalluv <https://github.com/j-i-l/pyAlluv>`_ with the aim to integrate seamlessly into matplotlib.

It's work in progress... 

To install it simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/tools4digits/pyalluv.git
    

You can find several working examples in the `examples`_ folder.
